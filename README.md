Project Steps: 
  - **Development Environment Setup:** Google Colab for initial experimentation 
  - **Local LLM Selection:** Research and select a local-executable LLM model, ensuring compatibility with both Colab and a local environment
  - **Embedding Model Selection:** Identify and select an embedding model that can operate locally, also verifying its compatibility with Colab and a local setup
  - **Data Prep:** Gather and prepare datasets to be included
  - **Workflow & Architecture**: Construct and integrate dataset, LLM & Embedding Model
  - **Testing:** Test system interactions & performance evaluatation in Colab
  - **Local Development Environment Setup:** Transition to VS Code for full local development
